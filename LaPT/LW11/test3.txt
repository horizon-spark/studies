This Programming Language Python Tutorial is very well suited for beginners and also for experienced 
programmers. This specially designed free Python tutorial will help you learn Python programming most 
efficiently, with all topics from basics to advanced (like Web-scraping, Django, Learning, etc.) with 
examples. 
What is Python? 
Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language. Python programming 
language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, and Machine Learning applications, along 
with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry. Python language is being used by almost all 
tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc. 
Writing your first Python Program to Learn Python Programming 
There are two ways you can execute your Python program: 
First, we write a program in a file and run it one time. 
Second, run a code line by line. 
Here we provided the latest Python 3 version compiler where you can edit and compile your written code 
directly with just one click of the RUN Button. So test yourself with Python first exercises. 
Welcome to the Python tutorial section! Here, we’ll cover the essential elements you need to kickstart your 
journey in Python programming. From syntax and keywords to comments, variables, and indentation, we’ll 
explore the foundational concepts that underpin Python development. 
In this segment, we delve into the fundamental aspects of handling input and output operations in Python, 
crucial for interacting with users and processing data effectively. From mastering the versatile print() 
function to exploring advanced formatting techniques and efficient methods for receiving user input, this 
section equips you with the necessary skills to harness Python’s power in handling data streams seamlessly. 
Python offers, enabling you to manipulate and manage data with precision and flexibility. Additionally, we’ll 
delve into the dynamic world of data conversion with casting, and then move on to explore the versatile 
collections Python provides, including lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and arrays. 
By the end of this section, you’ll not only grasp the essence of Python’s data types but also wield them 
proficiently to tackle a wide array of programming challenges with confidence. 
From performing basic arithmetic operations to evaluating complex logical expressions, we’ll cover it all. 
We’ll delve into comparison operators for making decisions based on conditions, and then explore bitwise 
operators for low-level manipulation of binary data. Additionally, we’ll unravel the intricacies of assignment 
operators for efficient variable assignment and updating.
